![Gameplay Gif](src/main/resources/readme/gameplay.gif)

A Java-based desktop game where you play as Nibs the raccoon, collecting paperclips scattered around a cluttered office desk.
Built entirely from scratch using Java and Swing, this project focuses on game logic, graphics rendering, and input handling.

## Purpose

The goal of Nibs‚Äô Paperclip Collector is to create a fun game built with a custom Java engine.
It started as a personal project inspired by the mobile game Cookies Inc., focused on recreating its core gameplay mechanics.

## Features

Play as Nibs the raccoon and collect scattered paperclips to increase your clip count

Buy upgrades to increase the value and spawn rate of paperclips

Smooth frame timing with delta-based game loop

Adjustable clip size, resolution, and scaling options

Config-based settings

Lightweight custom rendering (no external engines)

Modular codebase for future expansion (menus, sounds, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- **Java 25** ‚Äì Language
- **Swing / AWT** ‚Äì Rendering and input handling
- **Maven** ‚Äì Project management and dependency system
- **Jackson** ‚Äì JSON configuration and save system
